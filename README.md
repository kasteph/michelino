An Arduino-powered car. It does basic collision detection and can be controlled via [Zulip](https://github.com/surenm/remote-controller)
and the [web](https://github.com/surenm/remote-controller).

Jesse and I did a quick Google search to see if anyone had written a blog post on making an Arduino car and found that
Miguel Grinberg had [written a series](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/category/Arduino). I read
through his tutorial and found that while the rest of it was a bit too much for what we were trying to accomplish, the
[parts and components post](blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/building-an-arduino-robot-part-i-hardware-components) were extremely invaluable.

We bought all of the parts recommended by Miguel except for the Bluetooth Slave. We decided early on that we wanted the car to
be controlled via Zulip and possibly a web interface so we bought the [Arduino CC3000 WiFi shield](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1491) instead.
